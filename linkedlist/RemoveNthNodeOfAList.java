/**
 * LeetCode 19: Remove Nth Node From End of List
 *
 * ğŸ”¸ Problem Statement:
 * Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
 *
 * ğŸ”¹ Constraints:
 * - The list is non-empty and contains at least 1 node.
 * - 1 <= n <= size of the list
 *
 * ğŸ”¸ Solution Approach (Two Pointers / Fast-Slow Technique):
 * - Use two pointers (`fastPointer` and `slowPointer`) both initialized to the head.
 * - Move `fastPointer` `n` steps ahead.
 * - Then move both pointers one step at a time until `fastPointer` reaches the end.
 * - `slowPointer` will then point to the node just before the one that needs to be removed.
 * - Remove the target node by updating `slowPointer.next`.
 * - Edge Case: If `fastPointer` becomes null after the initial `n` steps,
 *   it means the head needs to be removed (e.g., removing the nth node from a list of size n).
 *
 * ğŸ”¹ Time Complexity: O(L), where L is the length of the list.
 * ğŸ”¹ Space Complexity: O(1)
