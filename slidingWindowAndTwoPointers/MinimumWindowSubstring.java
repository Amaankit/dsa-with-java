package slidingWindowAndTwoPointers; /**
 * üß© Problem Statement:
 * Given two strings `s` and `k`, find the minimum length substring in `s`
 * which contains all characters of `k` (including duplicates).
 * The order of characters does not matter.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "aabcabcbb", k = "abc"
 * Output: "abc"
 *
 * ‚úÖ Constraints:
 * - Characters in `k` can repeat.
 * - The result must include all characters in `k` with the required frequency.
 *
 * üí° Approach (Sliding Window + HashMap - Detailed Explanation):
 *
 * 1. **Build a frequency map** for string `k` using a HashMap. This helps us track which characters
 *    we need to include in the window and how many times.
 *    For example, if k = "aabc", then freqMap = {a:2, b:1, c:1}.
 *
 * 2. Initialize two pointers `leftIndex` and `rightIndex` to represent a sliding window in string `s`.
 *    We'll slide `rightIndex` forward to expand the window, and `leftIndex` to shrink it once all
 *    characters from `k` are matched.
 *
 * 3. For each character added to the window (moving `rightIndex`):
 *    - Decrement its count in the map.
 *    - If that character was required (its count was > 0), increase the `count` of matched characters.
 *
 * 4. Once `count` becomes equal to the length of `k`, it means the current window contains all
 *    characters from `k` (with required frequency). Now, try to shrink the window by moving `leftIndex`
 *    while still maintaining a valid window.
 *
 * 5. During shrinking:
 *    - If the current window is smaller than the previously found minimum, update `minimumLength` and `startingIndex`.
 *    - Restore the count of the character at `leftIndex` in the map.
 *    - If the restored count goes above 0, it means that character is now missing from the window,
 *      so decrement the `count`.
 *
 * 6. Continue this process until the entire string `s` is traversed.
 * 7. Finally, if a valid window is found, return the substring using `startingIndex` and `minimumLength`.
 *    Otherwise, return an empty string.
 *
 * üïê Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of `s`.
 * üîÅ Space Complexity: O(m), where m is the number of distinct characters in `k`.
