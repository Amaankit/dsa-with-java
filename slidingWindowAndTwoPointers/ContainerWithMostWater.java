/**
 * LeetCode 11: Container With Most Water
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Problem Statement:
 * You are given an array of integers height of length n.
 * There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints
 * of the i-th line are at (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
 *
 * Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container
 * that holds the most water.
 *
 * Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Constraints:
 * - n >= 2
 * - 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Solution Approach (Two Pointer Technique):
 * - Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`), and one at the end (`right`)
 * - At each step, calculate the area formed by the two lines:
 *     - width = right - left
 *     - height = min(height[left], height[right])
 * - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward,
 *   since that might help increase the area by increasing the minimum height
 * - Repeat this until left meets right
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity: O(n)
 * ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity: O(1)
